# Dynarray.C
*author: Grant S. Ralls*

## Motivation
Implementations of a dynamically sized array already exist. I wanted to build my own to morph my theoretical knowledge into working knowledge. I have a bigger project coming up soon that will require these arrays so I figured why not make it into a repo.

## Build Steps
I'm still learning about C build pipelines. I'll write more here once I understand this better.
